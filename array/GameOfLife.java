 According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

 Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

 Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

 Example:

 Input:
 [
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,0,0]
 ]
 Output:
 [
 [0,0,0],
 [1,0,1],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,1,0]
 ]
 Follow up:

 Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

     * 这题主要是follow-up要求in place解法；但是直接改变0，1的话会影响后面的结果；
     * 技巧是用不同的数字表示这一代的生死，最后再把这些数字恢复。很像dfs里常用的标记遍历的手段，比如Max Area of Island之类的。
     * 另外这题需要8个方向遍历，写法也值得借鉴。
     *
     * 这题的另一个follow up问如果有个极大的矩阵怎么办。一个思路可以考虑用别的数据结构保存稀疏矩阵(sparse matrix)，如果活人少的话。
